Composing Digital Media Project 2, Rhetorical Visual Argument


10/11: 

For this project, I want to call attention to the harm in victim blaming, specifcally by focusing on the question, "What were you wearing?" that victims of assault are commonly asked.  
I have begun by centering a tweet asking victims, if comfortable, to share what they were wearingw when assaulted.  I found this tweet in a buzzfeed article, and the responses to the thread are all included in the article: https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jtes/sexual-assault-survivors-answer-the-question-what-were-you-w 

Rather than including screenshots of all of the verbal responses, I was inspired by a museum exhibit (described in my proposal discussion post) that used outfits inspired by respondants' answers to the above question.  Rather  than using the exact outfits, which some demonstrations do, the exhibit uses -- and my visual argument will use -- representative outfits based on the written responses to give a visual representation, therefore yielding a stronger emotional impact. 

I plan to focus my rhetorical message on the use of empty space in the piece, leaving some of the message and the emotional impact open to audience understanding.
