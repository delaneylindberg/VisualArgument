Composing Digital Media Project 2, Rhetorical Visual Argument


Preview, 10/11: 

For this project, I want to call attention to the harm in victim blaming, specifcally by focusing on the question, "What were you wearing?" that victims of assault are commonly asked.  
I have begun by centering a tweet asking victims, if comfortable, to share what they were wearingw when assaulted.  I found this tweet in a buzzfeed article, and the responses to the thread are all included in the article: https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jtes/sexual-assault-survivors-answer-the-question-what-were-you-w 

Rather than including screenshots of all of the verbal responses, I was inspired by a museum exhibit (described in my proposal discussion post) that used outfits inspired by respondants' answers to the above question.  Rather  than using the exact outfits, which some demonstrations do, the exhibit uses -- and my visual argument will use -- representative outfits based on the written responses to give a visual representation, therefore yielding a stronger emotional impact. 

I plan to focus my rhetorical message on the use of empty space in the piece, leaving some of the message and the emotional impact open to audience understanding. 



Draft, 10/19: 

I've been having a bit of a creativity block and have been really trying to figure out how I want to send the message I intend to deliver.  After discussing with the class on Monday and trying out some new techniques, I decided to switch around my original concept to make the message a bit clearer.  Though my original plan was to display inspired outfits from some of the Twitter responses, I have instead decided to use screenshots of the tweets from the Buzzfeed article.  Many of the Tweets include ages and surrounding circumstances, and I feel as though it may limit the audience's imagination (and thus, emotional impact) if the outfits are viewed from my imaginatory lense.  Since many of these updates have been made just in the last day or so since showing my visual argument to the class, the Draft I have updated is very much still a work in progress; I plan at this point to (maybe) add a few more tweet screenshots and add borders to the present screenshots to add some more dimension within the collage.
